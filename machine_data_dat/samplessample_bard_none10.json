A galaxy is a large, gravitationally bound collection of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. The universe is everything that exists, including space, time, matter, and energy. Time is a fundamental part of the universe. It is a measure of the progression of events, and it is relative to the observer. Space is the three-dimensional extent of the known universe. It is the space in which all objects and events occur. Matter is the substance of which physical objects are composed. It is made up of atoms, which are the smallest particles of an element that can exist. Energy is the ability to do work. It can be in many forms, such as heat, light, sound, and electricity.\n\nI hope this is what you are looking for.
