Thirty floors below, the city pulsed like a living entity, the bustle of tiny cars and tinier pedestrians a blur of sound and color. She stared at the black ink on her wrist, the delicate lines of the butterfly tattoo her only companion.\n\nA smile spread across her face as she remembered the old man in the dimly lit tattoo parlor, his gnarled hands steady as he etched the intricate design on her skin. He had whispered an incantation in a language she couldn't understand and then handed her a small vial of iridescent liquid.\n\n\"For a moment, you will have wings,\" he said, his eyes glinting with mischief.\n\nRiley uncorked the vial and let the contents seep into her tattoo. Almost instantly, the butterfly shimmered and lifted off her skin, its wings flapping gently as it hovered above her palm.\n\nWith a deep breath, she stepped off the edge of the rooftop, her heart pounding in her chest.

It had been uninhabited for centuries, forgotten by time. The mansion's old, broken windows reflected the full moon's light as it filtered through the dense foliage overhead. Ivy had overtaken the once pristine facade, and the crumbling bricks were now home to spiders and other creatures of the night.\n\nAs midnight approached, the mansion's grand doors creaked open all on their own. A gust of wind blew through the halls, carrying with it the voices of the past. The chandelier hanging above swayed so violently that its gold-plated chains began to loosen.\n\nIn the center of the grand hall, a figure formed out of the darkness. Dressed in an elegant gown, a woman stepped forward. It was her spirit that haunted the mansion, cursed to roam the halls for all eternity. As the clock struck midnight, she began to dance, her footsteps barely audible against the distant echoes of laughter.\n\nUnknown to her, a traveler had stumbled upon the mansion that very night. He hid in the shadows, watching her dance with a broken heart.

They're closing in. You must go now.\"\n\nEliza's eyes roamed the empty street around her, searching for any signs of danger. The voice on the other end was her only lifeline. She had to trust them. \"What do I do?\"\n\n\"Go to the old warehouse at the edge of town. You'll find everything you need there. Your new life is waiting.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Eliza whispered, her voice shaking.
