The storm was closing in, though the townsfolk said this one would be different. They whispered of a ship that would emerge from the darkness, a spectral vessel with a message from the sea itself.\n\nMy destination loomed overhead, the old lighthouse abandoned for years. Its ancient purpose of guiding ships to safety had long been replaced by modern technology. I unlocked the door and ascended the stone steps, clutching the tarnished lantern that cast eerie shadows on the walls.\n\nAt the top of the lighthouse, I found a single candle and a tattered book of matches. Beside them lay a note, scrawled in ink, \"Light the way for the lost.\"\n\nThe moment I struck the match, the skies opened, and thunder shook the foundation. With trembling hands, I lit the candle, now the vessel's only beacon. The lantern's weak light spilled out into the infinite darkness, and I held my breath.\n\nSuddenly, a ship appeared, materializing from the tempest. Figures stood upon the deck, their faces contorted with sorrow and rage. They raised their hands, a collective gesture of gratitude and vengeance.
