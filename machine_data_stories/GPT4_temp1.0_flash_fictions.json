It was said that if one could reach out at the right moment and with the right intention, a single drop of this stream could alter the course of fate.\n\nTonight, Catira stood on the edge of space and time, heart pounding, waiting for the moment to seize what she believed was rightfully hers. A deathbed promise bound her to bring her loved one back, and she felt the weight of her inherited destiny like a noose around her neck.\n\nAs the crescent moon hung above, the air shimmered, and Catira knew she must not hesitate. She stretched her trembling hand into the current, and immediately felt the force tugging her back.\n\nThe villagers heard her gasp as the memory of her loved one coursed through her veins, blinding in its intensity. Then, the whispers died, and the air returned to stillness.\n\nYears later, Catira\u2019s lover walked among the living once more, but he no longer recognized her, and his eyes were now filled with the distant melancholy of someone who belonged to another time.", "120": "In a place where the sky stretched beyond the horizon, a cellar-door remained, tucked under a mound of brown grass \u2013 all that was left of a village swallowed by the greedy forest.\n\nOn the day the sun and moon aligned, Sam had finally mustered the courage to open that door. Beckoning him from his dreams, it had made him promises of secrets and whispered horrors buried deep underground.\n\nA room, unchanged since it was last seen by human eyes, awaited him. Dust crawled like frost on ornate furniture, shrouding the memories that echoed within those rotting walls.\n\nSam approached an old gramophone. How had this tale of terror come to his ears, reaching out from an age long forgotten? His trembling fingers set the needle onto the vinyl, and the darkest strains of music he had ever heard rose from the sleeping record, distorted and chilling.\n\nHe felt the cold air surround him, and as he turned to the mirror, a lifeless face stared back.

The townsfolk would watch from afar, casting her suspicious glances and whispering that she was off to meet \"the ghost\" again. However, what happened inside the barn was much different from the supernatural encounters the town\u2019s people had imagined.\n\nIn the barn, the dusty air was thick with melody, as notes swirled around in an almost tangible way. Marjorie would hum softly, and the pieces of the old piano would respond, floating gracefully from the floor, as if eager to dance once again.\n\nMarjorie breathed life into this lonely instrument, forgotten like her after the passing of her beloved husband. It was him who had taught her the beauty of music.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, notes would dance through the cracks in the barn's walls, spilling into the night. A crescendo of harmony between the living and the dead.

Her heart skipped, her lungs empty. The matchstick trembled in her hands as she scraped it against the box, only to have the ember die halfway. Her second attempt was a brief blaze of glory, much like her first love. Just as she hesitated to light the third matchstick, she remembered the old man who sold her the box.\n\n\"The dance of the phoenix will restore what's lost,\" he had whispered, holding her gaze with his watery blue eyes. Even in her desperation, she had sensed the magic in those words.\n\n\"Do you believe?\" he had asked, as she had parted with her last few coins.\n\nThe darkness egged her on, and she struck the third match. This time, the flame leaped from the stick, wings of fire billowing into the shape of a phoenix.

Their game began again. The dust danced with them, as it had for the last fifty years, swirling around her mind's vivid image of the day they moved in\u2014a bride with dreams bigger than the open sky.\n\nShe fingered the tarnished locket around her neck, which held the faces she knew only as memories now. Her heart tightened as a tear negotiated the furrows in her cheek, a weathered road map of her life well-lived.\n\nSuddenly, Lucielle felt an eerie warmth in the center of her chest. She glanced out the window, and there it was\u2014a single green sapling, small but fierce, breaking through the hostile terrain.

Her voice was like a cold wind, from beyond the grave.\n\nSeated on his golden throne, Emperor Fidelis eyed her with a touch of skepticism. \"Show me.\"\n\nThe petite figure lifted her arm, producing a small, unassuming box. Faces leaned in, hold breaths held.\n\nWith reverence, she opened it, and a gleaming pearl arose, suspended in the air. Gasps filled the court as it emitted a warm light and a haunting melody.\n\n\"Beautiful,\" Fidelis whispered. \"Name your price.\"\n\n\"No gold,\" the figure replied. \"I seek knowledge.\"\n\nIntrigued, the emperor agreed. A wisp of smoke escaped from the pearl and entered the enigmatic stranger.\n\n\"What have I given?\" Emperor Fidelis asked.\n\nFor a heartbeat, the room paused. The figure claimed her hood to reveal a radiant visage, eyes blinded by her newfound wisdom. A swarm of blue butterflies fluttered into the hall and vanished.\n\n\"I have received the truth of the universe,\" she lamented. \"And in it, the doom that awaits us all.\"\n\nThe silence weighed heavy.

Jasper gazed at the empty stalls, feeling the burden of memories in his mother's old locket pressed against his chest.\n\nHe caught sight of her across the street. Her blonde hair was tinted gold by the streetlamp, suspended like a halo around a face he once knew too well. Ten years had passed since she had left without a word. They had both aged, but he could still see the same carefree spirit dancing in her eyes.\n\nShe spotted him, looking momentarily confused and then stricken. As the drizzle turned to rain, she started walking toward him, her steps hesitant, but determined.\n\nA sudden gust of wind snatched the locket from his grip. As the chain unravelled and looped around a lamppost, he lost his footing, slipping into oblivion.\n\n***\n\nWhen Jasper opened his eyes, the skies had cleared.

Gideon looked around, acknowledging the eerie silence, the smoky scent permeating through the room, and his pounding headache. The night before, he found himself unable to control his drinking at the local tavern.\n\nHe reluctantly shifted his gaze to the small box on the table beside the bed, where the floorboard creaked. He knew what lay inside: the compass. The only thing that tied him to his past.\n\nHis father crafted it, sang it seafaring lullabies to direct it's small, delicate needle. Every time the compass pointed home, Gideon felt compelled to return, only to be reminded why he left in the first place.\n\nAnger simmered within him; he could not grasp the paradoxical nature of the compass. Gideon's hand shot out and grabbed the box, holding it tightly. He held it strongly, as if to crush it completely. Panic set in as he realized he couldn't.\n\nTears prickled Gideon's eyes, cutting through the fog of his headache.

The wind whispered through the thinning trees, echoing the secrets they held. In her hands was a small, leather-bound book, the source of her newfound courage.\n\nFifty years ago, without warning, the townsfolk had discarded the contents of the library into the river. The angry water had swallowed the stories, as if to bear the burden of words no longer desired, no longer permitted to breathe life into imaginations.\n\nForbidden stories, each containing sunsets and shadows, laughter and tears, all washed away in a torrent of fear.

He surrendered sixteen years of bittersweet moments, hoping to give them away to a widower he barely knew, to spare her the pain of grief.\n\nThe Clock rewound sixteen years, and so did everyone's life.
