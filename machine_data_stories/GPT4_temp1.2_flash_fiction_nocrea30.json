Even the wading stilts from which stiltfish swam out at every second beat\u2014not a fraction sooner or later\u2014simply froze mid-slither as if pausing mid-breath. Valentina knew that Heaven, too, ceased blinking during this marvelous anomaly when, for half-heroic, half-nightmarish reasons, mystery bled grass-green across the Eastern meadowlands.\n\nMystery had not, in fact, accentuated the day Valentina clicked the family heirloom into hallowed tone that lingered like fog. Rather, a memory provoked by the stroke of sunlight against their eyes seized them and possessed them, inside-out, and they wondered wide-eyed if Time Does So Fly. Maybe if only a whimsical shower of sparks could awaken strength dormant in their gossamer-clad chest\u2014to accelerate infinity's door upon some inexpressibly urge\u2014then shadows hiding in violin-makers studios and between iris-petal layers would recognize Valentina, their sibling archangel.\n\nNo visible miracle broke the splintered sunlight chorus high-current this Wondrous occasion; yet fabric slowly unraveled at the frequency of tears and mud-stained footsteps, and the wind joked: today is in the Present danced.", "26": "There stood the last oak tree, covered with feather-like frost in the dead of winter, at the intersection of Medley Crossroads. Renowned for its legend, it evoked mysterious whispers from the villagers.\n\nTonight, as the wind howled through the hallowed, hollow trunk, a delicate visitor arrived \u2013 Seraphina, the elusive specter with a scarlet overcoat and chestnut hair.\n\nStories foretold that she emerged at the junction once every year to dance with the person to whom her heart belonged, enticing them into a world of enchantment before disappearing mysteriously after the stroke of midnight.\n\nYoung Emery tentatively approached the tree. Rumor had it; he was destined to electrify a congregation of curious onlookers with his iridescent violin. Driven by a newfound conviction, he lifted his arm to create the enchanting, symphonic sounds on the necromantic night. Seraphina appeared in a cloud of swirling mist, capturing Emery's gaze and danced, leaving a trail of scarlet rose petals in her wake.\n\nOnce the clock struck twelve, Seraphina snapped her fingers, and in an instant, transformed into a violin - ornate, with its golden rosewood aptly symbolizing Emery's blossoming love for the ethereal Seraphina. Until then, his melody would forever enrapture audiences, serving as the quintessence of magic during midnight.\n\nEmery\u2019s love remained unrequited, and between the enchantment of each night at the Medley Crossroads, his heart ached, snug in the strings of his new violin.", "27": "\"Sunset Plume\"\n\nA plume of cigar smoke recalled me to the belfry, a guilty penance negotiated under an agreement that Cynthia would not know to breathe life into me through stale fragrances. Her long-gone wedding ring had left its shape behind while my heart ached during my final ascent to make our sunset house within the house at near-bedtime\u2014a guilty search for loneliness no prescription dared replace.\n\nPeter Pan was perched exhaling through memories where pained stories lived, ripping away molten-orange vapors from fields stretching out below us catching cloud and robitussin wildfire alike as the steel-church sun curtain out both our moon pocked gazes and turning up angry lightning her niece left behind when the keys were left with the other lie, our forgotten olive-mouth home of teenage pier-watch smoke smiles where, in answering college, we caught Saturn eclipsed drinking sandwiches aglow in forever when time still bore promises instead of lists of errors.\n\nHer flesh erased each pull bending as pearl necklace umbilicals I had woven through lips when we first broke beyond the orbit no longer confined, rising into rings and drowning shackles contained to the space soon lost when trading light for darkness.", "28": "Title: The Melody of Solitude\n\nFor the first time in centuries, she was alone, absolutely alone. The crimson sun glossed the spectacle of the forgotten castle, weaving its sorcery onto each dilapidated brick. Underneath a facade of creeping ivy, Meridia felt her heart tighten with the thrum of her unfathomable eternity.\n\nMeridia the Enchantress, as the wandering poets christened her when stories were sung beneath crackling hearths, had changed countless hours with humans. She wove in and out of lifetimes, molding their fates ever so gently by a flicker of her melodious laughter, and therein lay her immortal magic.\n\nMeridia yearned for the laughter of babes, the flirting lashes over morning crumpets, the blazing debacles witnessed beneath enchanted moonlight. Yet humanity, like the fragile dewdrops adorning verdant rose petals, had dissipated. The final strains of folklore vanished, though the cascading wellspring of the fair folk poured her lifeblood forwards, tunneled in the solitude of her songs.\n\nAs she waltzed upon the twilight-hued waves, she weaved her fingers along the silken manecrowns of moonlight roses. Miracles took shape, unfathomable marvels born tomorrow. Yet melody reincarnated, casting a gleaming eye on all corners of the world, whispering, serenading.\n\n\u201cNever forsaken, beloved humanity,\u201d Meridia sang. \u201cMay destiny bloom again.\u201d", "29": "As the subway train screeched to a halt, Diane tore her scuffed, red bag from the sweaty grip of the anonymous hand. Once again, destiny had spared her belongings from vanishing into the pit of the underground.\n\nA forgotten, dusty ripped ticket roll collided with her shins on her way out. Tides of intrigued passengers dragged it like abrasive waves. Their eyes callously fixed within a sea of self-importance, not a drop of empathy in their bones.\n\nThe first ticket had blurred rectangular blue marks - an indicator of its expiration. The prospect of change riding under the murky railway haunted her conscience. Despite heated confrontation pooled in the nebulous thoughts, doubtful contemplation suppressed her haste. She delved further, ripping away countless layers with increasing desperation. The tiresome journey scratched away at her reality.\n\nAre we passengers unaware of our ultimate station?\n\nThe stirring thought emerged once more - an unsatisfied craving in her labyrinthine existence. Glancing at the lifeless eyes averted from humanity - relinquishing responsibility with mechanical apathy - resolve solidified within her.\n\nCloaked by twilight, the steel beast grew restless; doors rumbled shut. Amidst thunderous parting clamors, Diane hurled the lifeless ticket stub into the unknown, hoping to reunite with prophetic truth separating passage from pilgrimage."}
