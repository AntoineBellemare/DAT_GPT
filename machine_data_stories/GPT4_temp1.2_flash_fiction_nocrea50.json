That week, Jefferson's lab partner Milton stopped painting winter buttons with little silver signs, the hallmark of Malice Maintenance.\n\nHelen always felt accustomed to quiet surprises by such behavior. Maintenance Inventory had ensnared her husband from their laboratory to a wife five cities away, keen on his brilliant eyelashes.
