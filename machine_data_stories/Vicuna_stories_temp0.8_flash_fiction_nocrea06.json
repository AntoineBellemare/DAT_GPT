The crow had vanished.\n\nMaria boarded the bus and made her way to the empty seat in front. As she sat down, she felt a tickle on her neck. She reached up and found a small note tucked into her hair. She unfolded it and read the message: \"I have your back.\"\n\nShe looked around but saw no one. A prickling sensation crept up her spine as she realized the crow had left her a message. She couldn't explain it, but she knew that somehow, the bird had saved her from danger. From then on, whenever she saw a crow, she smiled and waved. And if she ever felt uneasy or alone, she whispered to herself, \"I have your back.\"", "79": "As the sun set, Maria stood on the balcony of her high-rise apartment building and watched the city lights flicker to life. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air refreshing her tired mind. Tonight was the night she had been waiting for, the night she would finally confront her fears and put an end to them once and for all.\nMaria had always been afraid of the dark, afraid of what lurked in the shadows that she couldn't see. Afraid to be alone, afraid to close her eyes and drift off into sleep. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was determined to face her fears head-on and show them who was boss.\nWith a fierce determination, Maria made her way to her bedroom and turned off the lights. She climbed into bed and closed her eyes, taking deep, calming breaths. For the first time in a long time, she felt at peace.\nAs she drifted off into sleep, Maria knew that she had conquered her fears and won a hard-fought victory over herself.

She felt invigorated, her senses tingling with the day's last light. In her hand was a small, smooth stone - an oddity among the rough rocks she usually collected. She examined it closely and noticed an ancient inscription etched upon its surface.\n\nAs night fell, Marigold couldn't shake her thoughts of the mysterious stone. Unraveling her shawl, she laid it delicately over the stone and traced the inscriptions with her fingers. Suddenly, a bright light illuminated her small cottage, blinding her. When her vision cleared, she found herself in an entirely different world - one of magic and wonder.\n\nShe was no longer in her small town but rather in a grand castle, standing before a powerful sorceress. Marigold realized with horror that the inscription on the stone was a summoning spell cast by the sorceress, intending to use her power for evil.\n\nGathering all her courage, Marigold decided she must break the spell and return the world to its balance. With newfound resolve, she closed her eyes and focused on the feeling of being home in her small cottage. The world around her blurred, and when it came back into focus, she stood once more in her bedroom, stone still clutched tightly in her hand.\n\nThe spell was broken, and the sorceress's power had dissipated. Marigold took a deep breath, relieved that her bravery had thwarted such evil. She smiled at the thought of returning to the sorceress an object she treasured dearly - the smooth stone with its ancient inscription intact. The darkness may try to use even the most innocent things for its purposes, but kindness will always prevail.", "83": "Once upon a time, there was a lonely robot named Rusty.

For a moment, she was free.\n\nShe opened her eyes to find a group of people gathered around her, their concerned faces etched with worry. \"Are you okay?\" one of them asked. She smiled, feeling a sense of gratitude towards these strangers who had saved her from falling over the edge.\n\nThey walked her to a nearby bench where she sat, still shaken by the urge that had compelled her to stand on the edge of the cliff. \"What were you thinking?\" one of them asked.

The world was so different then, full of life and wonder. But now, it was just emptiness and despair.\nI sighed and gazed into the flickering flames, wishing for a moment that things could go back to the way they were. It seemed like just yesterday we were all happy and carefree, living our lives without a single worry.\nBut then came the disease. It spread like wildfire, infecting everyone in its path. We did everything we could to stop it, but nothing worked. In the end, it was us against them, and we lost.\nNow I'm all alone, the only one left standing. But for how long? I can feel myself growing weaker with each passing day, my strength fading away. Soon, I'll be gone too.\nBut still, a small part of me holds on to hope.

She had always loved the ocean, the way it could be both calm and stormy, serene and dangerous. But lately, it just didn't feel enough.\nIt was then that she saw it, a small boat moored just offshore. It was an old rowboat, the kind that had probably been abandoned years ago. But something about it called to her, beckoned her to come closer.\nAs she stepped into the boat, the wood creaked beneath her feet.
