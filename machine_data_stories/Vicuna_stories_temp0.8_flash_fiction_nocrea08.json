The wind whipped around her, tugging at her long black hair and making her shiver in the cool evening air. She had always been drawn to the edge, to the thrill of standing so close to the unknown. But tonight, she wasn't alone.\nA shadowy figure lurked in the darkness, watching her with hollow eyes. Maria felt a chill run down her spine and took a step back, but the figure advanced towards her. It was then that she noticed the razor-sharp claws protruding from its fingers, and the fangs bared in a sinister grin.\nMaria's heart raced as she tried to turn and run, but the creature was too fast. It lunged forward, claws outstretched, and Maria closed her eyes and braced for impact. But nothing happened. She opened her eyes again to find the creature lying at her feet, writhing in pain.\nMaria looked down at her hands and saw that they were glowing with a bright blue light. She had no idea where it had come from, but she knew one thing for sure - she wasn't going to let this creature harm anyone else.

She had no idea what had just happened, but one thing was for sure - she would never forget this night, or the power that lay within her.", "97": "As the sun began to set, Sarah sat on her porch with a heavy heart. The news of her beloved town being sold to a corporation had hit her hard. She had spent all her life in this small town and now it was about to change forever.\nSarah closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to hold back the tears. Suddenly, she heard a soft voice calling out to her. Curious, she followed the sound and found herself in front of an old tree that she had never seen before. The voice called out again, and this time she noticed a small door carved into the trunk of the tree.\nTentatively, Sarah reached out and opened the door, revealing a small key inside. Confused, she looked up and saw a figure in the distance beckoning to her. She followed the figure to a nearby pond where she discovered a boat waiting for her.\nAs she stepped into the boat, the figure disappeared, leaving Sarah alone on the calm water.

He had no family, no friends, and no pets. Every day he would wake up, eat breakfast, and then sit in his rocking chair staring out the window. The months passed by this way, each day indistinguishable from the last.\nOne morning, as Mr. Jenkins was sitting in his rocking chair, he saw a small bird perched on his windowsill. The bird looked at him and chirped, as if inviting him to come outside. Without thinking, Mr. Jenkins stood up and walked out of his house.\nAs he walked towards the bird, it flew off and landed on a branch in the garden. Mr. Jenkins followed it, feeling a sense of excitement he hadn't felt in years. The bird led him to a small flower bed where there was a patch of daisies. Mr. Jenkins knelt down and started picking the flowers, one by one.\nThe sound of laughter caught his attention and he looked up to see a group of children playing in the garden. They saw him picking the flowers and ran over to him. They asked him if he wanted to play with them and Mr. Jenkins hesitated for a moment before nodding his head yes.\nFrom that day on, Mr. Jenkins would spend every afternoon playing with the children in the garden. He made friends with them and even got a pet dog which he named Daisy after his favorite flower. Life had finally found a way to give Mr. Jenkins the love and companionship he had been missing for so long."}
