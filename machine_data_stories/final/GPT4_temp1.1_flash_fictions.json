He hardly remembers a life before eternity permeated his existence. Swirling his coffee, he watched the steam blend with the fog of his cigarette, each lost in darkness somewhere along its ascension. Now and forever, he was Soulkeeper.\n\nBut for how long?", "87": "Sir Rodrick descended on sparkling wings, his silver armor radiating color as he alighted on his gilded steed's saddle. A triumphant symphony accompanied his entrance, the shimmering mass of airborne beasts congregating around him.\n\nHis land below, Noctarium, plunged further into shadow.\n\nFor as The Great Knight governed by day, a queen ruled by night. Her essence melancholic as twilight, fleeting as moonlight clouded by the wings of phantom angels. Elusive, Queen Titania governed her realm in earnest, her devoted subjects flit like shadows over a silvery water realm. And during these nightly vigils, he rode ceaselessly, yearning for one furtive whisper, an exchanged breath.\n\nAwakening with the first sunbeams, he bore the burden of preventing union with his otherworldly queen. Sunlight permeated his very being as Titania's whispered syllables dissolved as kindly as a mother's lullaby.\n\nNo mortal eye could discern this delicate dance between light and dark \u2013 a romance so inevitable as dawn and dusk, so painful as joined hands refusing to let go.\n\nYet again their fingers brushed in the twilight, withering away with the whispers \"'til night my lady\" \"Until next eve, sir knight.\"\n\nEager sunrays scattered their final sighs, while a luminous moon waited to cloak their stolen inevitable touch.", "88": "At precisely eleven o'clock Orion McCreedy's peculiar gift stirred him from a full den of sleep.\n\nA single flawless note resonated through his skull. The old oak piano never faltered; it rendered its hymn each morning to accompany Orion's ennui as he stumbled upon the same checkered tiles.\n\nHe burrowed in his English muffin as crumbs articulated his forlorn thoughts on perfect harmony\u2014pointless beauty locked in an endless waltz, demanding answers but never providing even the simplest chord to a beggar's lullaby. That inhaled-scream tightened in his chest as a singular word danced upon his tongue: \"Hide.\"\n\nHow desperately he longed to hide! Just a moment sitting still like the condensation on the ticking clock, safe under its just slightly tarnished bronze: a speck of dissonance cradled beneath a calloused hand.\n\nSoon enough, Orion's fingers stumbled onto their fate for the day. Clumsy notes tinkled past his senseless yawns as if the sun itself glanced through columns of sound into Orion's empty living room. His white-knuckled grip plummeted through that chime of songs half-begun, a cacophony of dreams written in perfect meter but never signed \u2014prisoners trapped within his gift, heroes of an internal epic never to defy the anger of an unlooking world.", "89": "Title: The Escape Room\n\nJodie had always loved puzzles and riddles. The busier the world became, the more consumed she felt by the virtual reality of her escapes. Her insatiable craving led her to a new experience - The Space Between Places.\n\nThe premise was simple: participants who managed to complete the puzzles had the chance to transform their lives. It almost felt like cosmic law.\n\nTen steps inside the heavenly crimson building, Jodie realized this challenge presented a different kind of fear. And excitement. But she had to forge on. She always did.\n\nDespite its surrealistic appearance, the room looked just like a cozy caf\u00e9, filled with the most sumptuous-looking delicacies her eyes had ever seen. Beside each heavenly treat was a tablet filled with puzzles.\n\nShe moved on, solving each one effortlessly until she was puzzled by the final challenge - two doors had appeared. One reflected her deepest desires, the other, her most primal fears\u2014she had to choose.\n\nWith a sudden awareness of the power of choices, Jodie stepped back so abruptly that her foot touched what seemed to be an unseen trapdoor beside her. Instantaneously, it opened, and she fell downwards, spiraling\u2014not to an expected doom, but to an inexplicable sky.\n\nAs the ethereal crimson building vanished, she welcomed her newfound wings. The Space Between Places ceased to exist, and the discovery of Jodie's true escape met its worth: utter freedom.", "90": "A mysterious embrace encircled Rosalind each morning as she watered her plants. One day, the tender fondling grew more palpable and the spectral silhouette of a man materialized as the sun streamed through the misty panes of her conservatory. Entranced, she opened her curtains wider, and the figure solidified into Adrian\u2014a long-lost childhood sweetheart, who disappeared inexplicably years ago.\n\nTheir whispered conversations unearthed both entangled memories and noxious pain, the vines of their words withering or thickening in synchrony with their burgeoning love. Mesmerized by their shared past, Rosalind\u2019s perennials were exchanged for her spectral gardener, the unyielding devotion to both her plants and treasured companion now intertwined. \n\nBut as their love flourished like the emerald plant life in her conservatory, the escalating passion consumed even the gentle morning embrace. The overgrowth of a voracious appetite overcame the hushed restraint of their spectral trysts, leaving the tomb of warmth in its stead. The once plush wonderland now blighted by the ravenous need to reclaim life beyond the constraint of whispered secrets and candlelit silhouettes. \n\nBut such hunger could not be assuaged with simplicity. Adrian disintegrated, leaving Rosalind with wilted memories and bittersweet silence, locking away a once radiant world behind the closed curtains of her conservatory.", "91": "Margot balanced her weight on her tiptoes, her unwavering gaze locked on the ceiling of the ancient chapel. She couldn't afford to slip now; the fate of the village balanced in her hands. The abbot's prophecy sprawled across the curved walls invisibly but for the fireflies that illuminated them for brief, sporadic moments. Compiled over the last two hundred years, these centuries-worth of secrets formed the Thousand Steps to Seraphim, a mythical map to divine intervention.\n\nA gust of wind disturbed the somber quiet, sending chilling whispers down Margot\u2019s spine and snuffing out stowed candles. The fireflies scattered in frenzy.\n\n\"You're disturbing the peace,\" she hissed, as the figure stepped into the moonlight, suffused with an ominous shimmer.\n\n\"Legend has it that mortals who complete the Thousand Steps gain a single wish,\" the stranger chuckled, revealing eyes the same deep shade as the secrets inked on the ancient walls.\n\n\"So you've come to request my wish,\" Margot swallowed the tremble in her voice.\n\n\"To burden your soul,\" the stranger corrected, taking a slow step toward her.

Its water, still and reflective, functioned like a mirror, only magnifying the enigma of the place.\n\nFor days, she kept the hidden lake a secret, a quiet place to escape the growing turmoil at home.\n\nOne afternoon, as she approached, Abigail saw a girl sitting at the water's edge. With her feet dipping in the water, she seemed not to notice Abigail, absorbed in a peculiar stone she held in her hands. The girl was entranced, caressing the stone like she would a wild animal, her fingers brushing over its surface. Never had Abigail seen such a pearl-white stone, continuous patterns weaving across it like constellations in the night sky.\n\nIntrigued, she softly murmured, \"Oh, that's a beautiful stone.\"\n\nIn an instant, the girl was gone, leaving only a scattering of ripples and the iridescent stone.

Sissy, the five pumpkin-footed ducklings' nanny, observes him cautiously, feeling a mix of attraction and repulsion. Panchito, the old cantankerous donkey, wakes with a start and senses something familiar in the stranger's eyes. At the village\u2019s edge, Marigold's petals yawn and stretch, whispering mirthful gossip in the wind.\n\nNeither human nor ghost, the stranger possesses an otherworldly quality. Villagers huddle, casting disapproving darts towards him. Shopkeepers eye him skeptically as he lingers curiously by the window displays. \n\nA gust of wind whips wailing and laughter through the cobbled streets. Leaves converge into a cyclone, engulfing the stranger.

The rocking waves whispered tumultuous truths, making the truth of time seem irrelevant.\n\n\"Half past oceans and skies?\" I replied, testing the waters.\n\nA chuckle gurgled. Surprised, I looked back at her wrinkled, glassy eyes. \"Ah, a poet,\" she sighed.\n\nI stood mesmerized. A tumult of clouds gathered overhead, casting shadows on the old woman. Suddenly, a crow's call split the her silence.\n\nThe old woman gave an imperceptible nod.\n\n\"Midnight,\" she said airily.\n\nA breeze began to dance with our hair. I looked down at her hand, old and marbled, resting on her bag. She caught me staring and smiled, revealing a row of wave-worn stones for teeth.\n\n\"Come now,\" she said, stretching out her cracked palm. Hesitantly, I let her grasp my hand completely.\n\nWe waded into the surf, unable to resist its dance on the wet edge of tomorrow.

Vowing to preserve them, she traveled the stars, racing alongside photons and hitching rides on rogue waves.\n\nBut across the void, an entity also swam. It was the Call, a force that devoured stories and supped on grief. For centuries, Echo and the Call chased one another; one intent on creation, the other craving destruction.\n\nFinally, the Call cornered the weaver in a swirling vortex, hoping to obliterate her fragments of time. Their battle unfolded in silent fireworks, as Echo danced upon particles that spun like electrons around the rough fabric of reality.\n\nShowers of untold tales fell as stardust, streaming tears across the boundless sky. Echo's determination encased the Call's cosmic hunger within a loop of discarded dreams, and at last, there was a soft sigh worth a thousand breaths, a murmuration that echoed through eons gone by.\n\nAnd for a moment, the universe held its breath in utter silence.", "96": "Once a year in Ambrosia, when the moon was ripe and the stars clustered above like sugar crystals, the mystical roses bloomed. The arrival of these unique flowers brought hundreds of people to the sapphire ocean shore where they appeared. This time, a young boy named Kai stood amongst them, fervently scanning his surroundings.\n\nEvery story passed down through generations mentioned the roses' fragrance as a melody, a song only the devotees could hear. However, Kai had only ever been told these tales. Born deaf, he had come year after year in the hopes of catching a glimmer of the song he longed for.\n\nAs night clawed its way upon the horizon, the roses revealed themselves, seeping their way from the soil beneath. Petals enveloped in colors unseen whispered in the salty breeze, competing for attention, and the people listened - entranced. \n\nKai observed their reactions, hopeful, feeling each burst of color ripple through the soil below before reaching towards the ashen sky accompanied by gasps from spectators.

Nobody could quite say how it had started, or where they'd first tasted it, but this diet consisted of emotions.\n\nCuriously, not only were the myriad emotions delectable to Zaffre-37's inhabitants, they also gave them an incredible sense of vitality. There was a fringe benefit too - certain emotions affected their hue. Laughter turned them pink, nostalgia shaded them sepia, and melancholy dyed them blue.
